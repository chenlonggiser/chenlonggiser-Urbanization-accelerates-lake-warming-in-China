      The codes used in the article primarily serve data preprocessing, trend analysis, and attribution exploration. The specific purpose of each script is as follows:
1.Mat-to-csv.py: Format conversion of lake surface water temperature data.
2.NC-TIF.py: Preprocessing of climate factor data.
3.Theil-Sen estimator.py: Calculation of the warming rate of lake surface water temperature.
4.Mann-Kendall.py: Trend analysis of lake surface water temperature warming rates.
5.K-means.py: Classification of sample categories based on development intensity in lake basins.
6.Density trends.py: Analysis of density trends in lake surface water warming rates.
7.T-test.py: Significance testing of differences in lake surface water warming rates.
8.Spearman.py: Exploring the correlation between lake surface water warming rates, lake basin development intensity, and lake volume.
9.Random Forest.py: Attribution analysis of lake surface water warming.
10.Random Forest1.py: Attribution analysis of the temperature difference between lake water and air temperature.
11.Logarithmic function fitting.py: Sensitivity analysis of lake surface water temperature to lake volume.
      Additionally, the Heihe-Tengchong Line data in the article is used to distinguish the LSWT warming rates between the southeast and northwest sides of China; the impermeable surface area data is used to calculate the intensity of watershed development; the lake information is used to match the extracted lake IDs with their attributes; LSWT data refers to the raw data of lake surface water temperature; the Mann-Kendall test is used for trend analysis; Random Forest is employed to explore the attribution of lake warming; Random Forest1 is used for attribution analysis of WATWD; sensitivity analysis of LSWT to changes in lake volume is conducted to statistically assess the sensitivity of LSWT to volume changes; Spearman correlation is used for testing relationships between variables; and the Theil-Sen estimator is applied to evaluate the rate of warming of lake surface water temperature.
